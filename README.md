# SMB2forXamarinForms
Xamarin.Forms sample application to transfer file via SMB 2.0.  
This is using [SMBLibrary](https://github.com/TalAloni/SMBLibrary).
Now SMB 1.0 protocol is not supported in windows 10 by default, so SMBLibrary is very useful to implement file transfer via smb 2.0.  
I developed and published this sample because I could not find any sample using SMB 2.0 in Xamarin.Forms at this time (April 2020).
